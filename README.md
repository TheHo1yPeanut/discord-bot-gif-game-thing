# discord bot gif game thing

 <li><i>!GIFgame</i> - initializes the game, 30s timeout timer</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the command <i>!GIFgame</i> is called the bot sends a random gif into the channel where the command was initialized. The bot then asks the user who initialized the command for the name of the GIF. The next response by the user is recieved as the answer (no prefix needed). If <i>You win!</i> is not displayed after the user's answer that means that the user lost (or there was an out of bounds exception but that is rare).</p>
